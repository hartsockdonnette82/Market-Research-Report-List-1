<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Nitrate Fertilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crystalline</li><li>Granular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Calcium nitrate fertilizer is available in two primary market types: crystalline and granular. Crystalline calcium nitrate is a fine, powdery form, highly soluble in water, making it ideal for liquid fertilizers and foliar applications. Granular calcium nitrate, on the other hand, consists of larger, solid particles, suitable for direct soil application, providing slow-release nutrients. Both types supply calcium and nitrogen, essential for plant growth, but differ in application methods, solubility, and release rates, catering to diverse agricultural needs.</p></p>

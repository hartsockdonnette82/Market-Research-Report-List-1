<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Petroleum Pipeline Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmission</li><li>Gathering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The petroleum pipeline infrastructure market consists of two primary types: transmission and gathering. Transmission pipelines are large-diameter pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products over long distances, connecting production areas to refineries and distribution centers. In contrast, gathering systems are smaller pipelines that collect petroleum from multiple production sites, such as oil fields, and transport it to processing or transmission facilities. Together, these systems ensure efficient movement and distribution of petroleum resources across various regions.</p></p>

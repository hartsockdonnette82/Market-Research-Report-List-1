<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wound Drainage Sets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Vacuum Drainage</li><li>Low Vacuum Drainage</li><li>Gravity Drainage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wound drainage sets are essential in managing fluid accumulation post-surgery. High vacuum drainage utilizes negative pressure to remove excess fluids efficiently, making it suitable for larger wounds. Low vacuum drainage provides a gentler suction, allowing for more controlled fluid removal, ideal for smaller or less active drainage. Gravity drainage relies on gravity to facilitate fluid flow from the wound to a collection reservoir, making it straightforward and effective for superficial wounds. Each type serves specific clinical needs based on wound characteristics.</p></p>

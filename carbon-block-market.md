<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Block Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extruded Type</li><li>Compressed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Carbon Block market comprises two primary types: Extruded and Compressed. Extruded Carbon Blocks are formed by forcing a mixture of carbon and binding agents through a mold, creating uniform, dense blocks ideal for water filtration due to their consistent porosity and high adsorption capacity. Compressed Carbon Blocks are made by compacting carbon powder under high pressure, resulting in a robust structure with excellent contaminant removal efficiency, often used in industrial and residential filtration systems. Both types cater to diverse purification needs.</p></p>

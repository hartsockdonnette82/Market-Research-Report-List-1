<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-Expanded</li><li>Self-Expanded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve market is segmented into two main types: balloon-expanded and self-expanded valves. Balloon-expanded valves are deployed using a balloon to expand the valve into position, providing a controlled and precise fit. In contrast, self-expanded valves rely on a nitinol frame that naturally expands upon release, adapting to the annulus shape. Each type has distinct advantages in terms of ease of placement, longevity, and patient outcomes, catering to diverse clinical needs in congenital heart disease treatment.</p></p>

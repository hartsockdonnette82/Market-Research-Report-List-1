<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pickup Truck Disc Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opposed Piston</li><li>Floating Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pickup truck disc brake market features two primary types: opposed piston and floating caliper systems. Opposed piston brakes utilize two pistons pushing against the brake pads from either side of the rotor, providing strong braking force and better heat dissipation. Floating caliper brakes, on the other hand, have a single or dual piston setup that moves with the caliper, allowing for more lightweight design and easier installation. Both types cater to the diverse needs of pickup truck performance and safety.</p></p>

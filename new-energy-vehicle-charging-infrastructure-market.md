<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Energy Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Charging Pile</li><li>AC Charging Pile</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The New Energy Vehicle (NEV) charging infrastructure market comprises two primary types: DC charging piles and AC charging piles. DC charging piles are designed for rapid charging, converting direct current to power the vehicle's battery directly, significantly reducing charging time, often to under an hour. In contrast, AC charging piles supply alternating current, which requires the vehicle’s onboard charger to convert it to direct current, resulting in longer charging times, typically suited for home or public charging stations with lower power demands.</p></p>
